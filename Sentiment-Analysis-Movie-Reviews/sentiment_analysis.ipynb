on , but the people of new york are not happy . \\nin fact , they're terrified . \\nas in spike lee's do the right thing a heat wave has the city in its grip , and peoples' tempers are flaring . \\nthe cool of night offers no respite : the neighborhood is being terrorized by a nocturnal psychotic killer who calls himself the son of sam . \\nno one knows who the son of sam is , and no one is safe . \\nall around new york people are different . \\naside from cultural groupings and ethnic neighborhoods there are differences between individuals . \\nin the italian american section of town a philandering husband named vinny ( john leguizamo ) tries to hide his trysts and sexual behavior from his long suffering newlywed wife dionna ( mira sorvino ) . \\nvinny's friend ritchie ( adrien brody ) hates disco , works at a gay strip club and doesn't want any of the neighborhood folks to know . \\nritchie's girl ruby ( jennifer esposito ) is trying to escape a reputation as a slut . \\neveryone's different , but nobody in the film wants to be framed as \\\" alien \\\" to the community . \\nunfortunately , the killings help create a climate of suspicion pits neighbor against neighbor . \\nopinion : director spike lee's summer of sam is not about a psycho killer . \\nnor is it about cops trying to apprehend him . \\nit's about differences and how , given the right conditions , even close neighbors can fan the hostile flames of irrational suspicion . \\none thing i found interesting in summer of sam was the use of sex . \\nin other movies sex is glamorized . \\nfor example , james bond gets a sexual reward for winning . \\nor boring made-for-video \\\" suspense \\\" movies are spiked with gratuitous lingerie scenes just to keep the audience awake . \\nand every movie or soap opera character in these flicks seems to have expert sexual prowess . \\nnot so with summer of sam . \\nin a very gutsy move director spike lee shows sex without fantasy . \\nsex is there , but it isn't gratuitous or titillating . \\nin fact , some of the main characters are downright lousy in bed . \\nsex is in the film because ( sexual ) deviance is part of the film's major theme of \\\" difference \\\" breeding hostility . \\nin my opinion this kind of movie sex is cutting edge for 1999 , as rare and thought-provoking in american cinema as showing a spanking . \\n\",\n          \"titantic , writer and director james cameron's much anticipated and sometimes ridiculed $200 , 000 , 000 epic , arrives shortly into the theaters so the question naturally arises , whether the film is worth it ? \\nas a business proposition , it seems hard to see how it can ever break even , but as a movie it is nothing short of wonderful . \\nif you've already neatly categorized it as yet another disaster movie a la volcano or the poseidon adventure , think again . \\nthe movie is both a great love story told with the disaster as a backdrop and a portrayal of one of the world's most memorable disasters made real and personal by seeing it through the eyes of two young lovers . \\nin either case , it is filmmaking at its best . \\nwhen we entered the press screening , my wife asked the publicity rep if there would be an intermission since the film runs three and a quarter hours long . \\nhe said no but that the time would go by so fast she'd never notice the length . \\namazingly , he was right . \\ntitanic is one of the few long films that doesn't suffer because of it . \\nthe lush picture , filmed by russell carpenter in 70mm , opens in the present with two diving subs exploring the wreck of the titanic on the bottom of the ocean . \\nfortune hunter brock lovett ( bill paxton ) leads the expedition looking for the world's most valuable diamond necklace that went down with the ship , known back then as \\\" the ship of dreams . \\\" \\nthe necklace's hundred-year-old former owner , rose dewitt bukater ( gloria stuart ) , finds brock to tell him her story . \\nalthough almost all of the movie happens in flashback , one of the engineers shows the elderly rose exactly how the ship was sunk . \\nusing a computer simulation , the movie takes the time to explain what will happen later , which adds immensely to making a lucid story out of what would have otherwise been hopelessly confusing . \\nafter twenty minutes , the story makes its jump to the past as the titanic leaves on her maiden voyage . \\nin a classic movie theme , the two parts of the ship , first class and steerage ( third-class ) exist in sharp contrast . \\nthe strength of the script is the way it paints the differences between rich and poor without excessive moralizing . \\nentering the ship on its day out is rose along with her millionaire fiance , cal hockley , played with perfect snobbishness by billy zane . \\nand thanks to a last minute winning poker hand , an itinerant artist named jack dawson gets himself into a little shared cabin in third class . \\neven with her own promenade deck , rose feels trapped on the ship , what with an upcoming marriage to a man she loathes . \\nin contrast , jack can barely contain his euphoria at being on board . \\nafter jack saves rose from committing suicide , they start a brief but impassioned love affair . \\nnever tawdry and rarely explicit , their romance has the power to sweep the audience into the story . \\nleonardo dicaprio in his best performance ever plays jack with confidence and charisma . \\nin so many ways , small and large , he makes all the right decisions in his approach to the part . \\nwhen he confronts cal , for example , he remains composed and polite and yet subtly undermines every one of cal's supercilious put-downs . \\nkate winslet gives a wonderfully captivating performance as young rose . \\nthe chemistry between these two academy award nominees , him for what's eating gilbert grape and her for sense and sensibility , is nothing short of astonishing . \\nfrom the scene where he embarrasses her by repeatedly asking if she loves her finace to the beautiful one of them hanging off the ship's bow to the one where she embarrasses him by asking him to paint her nude , they dazzle the screen with a pair of mesmerizing performances . \\nif the film breaks after an hour and a half , which is how long cameron wisely waits to have the iceberg show up , you will still get one of the best films of the year . \\npeter lamont's sets are more than authentic . \\none scene , for example , starts with the planning-to-retire captain , played with insouciance by bernard hill , having his tea on deck . \\nit then shifts to the ship's massive gears and then to the bright-hot boiler room filled with sweating muscular men shoveling in the coals . \\nthe handsome interior common rooms of the ship resemble a palace more than an ocean liner . \\neasily the most fascinating part of the story is what happens after the iceberg hits and before the battle with the water begins in earnest . \\nat first , since the iceberg tears a series of little gashes in the hull , not some big gaping hole , the passengers view the hit as more of curiosity than anything else . \\nwhat a lark . \\nwe've struck an iceberg . \\nnow let's get back to our brandy and cigars . \\nthe ship's musicians play like troopers through it all , even after the panic sets in . \\nafter all , they see it as their duty to calm the passengers . \\nwhen the musicians are about to die , they politely thank each other for the pleasure of being able to play together , and they mean it . \\ntheir civility borders on insanity , but it is touching nevertheless . \\nthe story is so rich that my description has merely touched the surface . \\nthere are more than enough characters to love and to hate , and all of the casting is dead-on . \\nspecial effects work best when their presence becomes almost undetectable . \\nin titanic , for which he created a nine-tenths scale model of the entire ship , cameron strove for accuracy at all costs . \\nthe most dramatic moment in the film happens when the ship breaks in two , and the front section becomes vertical in the water . \\npeople are flung like ants either into the water to be shortly frozen to death or into other parts of the ship to be crushed immediately . \\nbesides being romantic and dramatic , the script includes liberal doses of humor . \\nfrom the many deliciously subtle verbal put-downs to the physical comedy , as when jack teaches rose to spit like a man , the show elicits laughter in addition to perhaps a few tears . \\n \\\" it's good-bye for a little while , \\\" a less than confident father tells his little girl since it was indeed women and children first . \\n \\\" this boat's for mommies and children . \\nthere'll be a boat in a little while for daddies . \\\" \\nbasically there was a design decision to have fewer than half of the necessary life boats -- it made the decks look too crowded otherwise . \\nperhaps the sinking is best summarized by one of the guggenheim's on-board the ship . \\nin the dining room with the lifeboats gone and the ship certain to sink , he is offered a life jacket by one of the crew . \\n \\\" no thanks , \\\" the elegantly attired guggenheim replies . \\n \\\" we're dressed in our best and would prefer to go down like gentlemen . \\nbut we would like a brandy . \\\" \\ntitanic runs 3 : 14 . \\nit is rated pg-13 for tastefully and delicately presented sex and nudity and would be fine for kids twelve and up . \\n\",\n          \"ingredients : down-on-his-luck evangelist , church \\nsynopsis : sonny dewey ( robert duvall ) is a tireless texas pentecostal preacher who unexpectedly catches his wife ( farrah fawcett ) in bed with another guy . \\nin a regrettable crime of passion he takes a baseball bat to the guy's head , and suddenly finds himself a fugitive for murder , and estranged from his wife and two kids . \\nto atone for his sins , sonny flees to a rural bayou town in louisiana and baptizes himself as a new creature - - the apostle e . f . as the apostle e . f . sonny's main mission is to revive an abandoned church community and preach the gospel at the local radio station . \\nsoon he sets about resurrecting the one way road to heaven holiness temple . \\nbut sonny knows his time is short ; one day the police will find him . \\nopinion : this movie is a thought-provoking look at an evangelist in real life terms . \\ni believe that robert duvall ( who is the producer , director , writer , and main star of the apostle ) deserves an oscar for his performance as sonny the religious crusader - - a performance which is so complex and realistic it ranks as one of the finest acting performances on film . \\nduvall's portrayal of a true believer is authentic , superb , and inspired ; it offers the audience a completely honest look at southern religion , as well as a portrait of a fallible , complicated man driven by his beliefs . \\nincidentally , in real life duvall was just as 'driven' in getting the project underway . \\nsince no major hollywood studio wanted to risk financing a complex movie about an evangelist , the apostle as a project lay dormant for almost 13 years before duvall was able to get it done , paying for its production with his own money ( about five million dollars ) . \\nin terms of hard-hitting realism and character portrayal the apostle would rank as one of the best movies of this decade , and i emphatically recommend the apostle for connoisseurs of stage and fine acting on film . \\nsimilarly , those with a steep background in pentecostal christianity would find the apostle a thought-provoking experience . \\non the other hand , the apostle's main strength - - duvall's preaching - - is also what limits the apostle's target audience . \\nin terms of plot and pure entertainment value , the apostle is definitely not for everyone . \\nteenagers , action fans , comedy fans , and people who find church completely boring should stay far away from this movie , since three quarters of the film is watching sonny preach at church . \\nin other words , the apostle is a four star performance , but with a very limited audience . \\n\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n

on , but the people of new york are not happy . \\nin fact , they're terrified . \\nas in spike lee's do the right thing a heat wave has the city in its grip , and peoples' tempers are flaring . \\nthe cool of night offers no respite : the neighborhood is being terrorized by a nocturnal psychotic killer who calls himself the son of sam . \\nno one knows who the son of sam is , and no one is safe . \\nall around new york people are different . \\naside from cultural groupings and ethnic neighborhoods there are differences between individuals . \\nin the italian american section of town a philandering husband named vinny ( john leguizamo ) tries to hide his trysts and sexual behavior from his long suffering newlywed wife dionna ( mira sorvino ) . \\nvinny's friend ritchie ( adrien brody ) hates disco , works at a gay strip club and doesn't want any of the neighborhood folks to know . \\nritchie's girl ruby ( jennifer esposito ) is trying to escape a reputation as a slut . \\neveryone's different , but nobody in the film wants to be framed as \\\" alien \\\" to the community . \\nunfortunately , the killings help create a climate of suspicion pits neighbor against neighbor . \\nopinion : director spike lee's summer of sam is not about a psycho killer . \\nnor is it about cops trying to apprehend him . \\nit's about differences and how , given the right conditions , even close neighbors can fan the hostile flames of irrational suspicion . \\none thing i found interesting in summer of sam was the use of sex . \\nin other movies sex is glamorized . \\nfor example , james bond gets a sexual reward for winning . \\nor boring made-for-video \\\" suspense \\\" movies are spiked with gratuitous lingerie scenes just to keep the audience awake . \\nand every movie or soap opera character in these flicks seems to have expert sexual prowess . \\nnot so with summer of sam . \\nin a very gutsy move director spike lee shows sex without fantasy . \\nsex is there , but it isn't gratuitous or titillating . \\nin fact , some of the main characters are downright lousy in bed . \\nsex is in the film because ( sexual ) deviance is part of the film's major theme of \\\" difference \\\" breeding hostility . \\nin my opinion this kind of movie sex is cutting edge for 1999 , as rare and thought-provoking in american cinema as showing a spanking . \\n\",\n          \"titantic , writer and director james cameron's much anticipated and sometimes ridiculed $200 , 000 , 000 epic , arrives shortly into the theaters so the question naturally arises , whether the film is worth it ? \\nas a business proposition , it seems hard to see how it can ever break even , but as a movie it is nothing short of wonderful . \\nif you've already neatly categorized it as yet another disaster movie a la volcano or the poseidon adventure , think again . \\nthe movie is both a great love story told with the disaster as a backdrop and a portrayal of one of the world's most memorable disasters made real and personal by seeing it through the eyes of two young lovers . \\nin either case , it is filmmaking at its best . \\nwhen we entered the press screening , my wife asked the publicity rep if there would be an intermission since the film runs three and a quarter hours long . \\nhe said no but that the time would go by so fast she'd never notice the length . \\namazingly , he was right . \\ntitanic is one of the few long films that doesn't suffer because of it . \\nthe lush picture , filmed by russell carpenter in 70mm , opens in the present with two diving subs exploring the wreck of the titanic on the bottom of the ocean . \\nfortune hunter brock lovett ( bill paxton ) leads the expedition looking for the world's most valuable diamond necklace that went down with the ship , known back then as \\\" the ship of dreams . \\\" \\nthe necklace's hundred-year-old former owner , rose dewitt bukater ( gloria stuart ) , finds brock to tell him her story . \\nalthough almost all of the movie happens in flashback , one of the engineers shows the elderly rose exactly how the ship was sunk . \\nusing a computer simulation , the movie takes the time to explain what will happen later , which adds immensely to making a lucid story out of what would have otherwise been hopelessly confusing . \\nafter twenty minutes , the story makes its jump to the past as the titanic leaves on her maiden voyage . \\nin a classic movie theme , the two parts of the ship , first class and steerage ( third-class ) exist in sharp contrast . \\nthe strength of the script is the way it paints the differences between rich and poor without excessive moralizing . \\nentering the ship on its day out is rose along with her millionaire fiance , cal hockley , played with perfect snobbishness by billy zane . \\nand thanks to a last minute winning poker hand , an itinerant artist named jack dawson gets himself into a little shared cabin in third class . \\neven with her own promenade deck , rose feels trapped on the ship , what with an upcoming marriage to a man she loathes . \\nin contrast , jack can barely contain his euphoria at being on board . \\nafter jack saves rose from committing suicide , they start a brief but impassioned love affair . \\nnever tawdry and rarely explicit , their romance has the power to sweep the audience into the story . \\nleonardo dicaprio in his best performance ever plays jack with confidence and charisma . \\nin so many ways , small and large , he makes all the right decisions in his approach to the part . \\nwhen he confronts cal , for example , he remains composed and polite and yet subtly undermines every one of cal's supercilious put-downs . \\nkate winslet gives a wonderfully captivating performance as young rose . \\nthe chemistry between these two academy award nominees , him for what's eating gilbert grape and her for sense and sensibility , is nothing short of astonishing . \\nfrom the scene where he embarrasses her by repeatedly asking if she loves her finace to the beautiful one of them hanging off the ship's bow to the one where she embarrasses him by asking him to paint her nude , they dazzle the screen with a pair of mesmerizing performances . \\nif the film breaks after an hour and a half , which is how long cameron wisely waits to have the iceberg show up , you will still get one of the best films of the year . \\npeter lamont's sets are more than authentic . \\none scene , for example , starts with the planning-to-retire captain , played with insouciance by bernard hill , having his tea on deck . \\nit then shifts to the ship's massive gears and then to the bright-hot boiler room filled with sweating muscular men shoveling in the coals . \\nthe handsome interior common rooms of the ship resemble a palace more than an ocean liner . \\neasily the most fascinating part of the story is what happens after the iceberg hits and before the battle with the water begins in earnest . \\nat first , since the iceberg tears a series of little gashes in the hull , not some big gaping hole , the passengers view the hit as more of curiosity than anything else . \\nwhat a lark . \\nwe've struck an iceberg . \\nnow let's get back to our brandy and cigars . \\nthe ship's musicians play like troopers through it all , even after the panic sets in . \\nafter all , they see it as their duty to calm the passengers . \\nwhen the musicians are about to die , they politely thank each other for the pleasure of being able to play together , and they mean it . \\ntheir civility borders on insanity , but it is touching nevertheless . \\nthe story is so rich that my description has merely touched the surface . \\nthere are more than enough characters to love and to hate , and all of the casting is dead-on . \\nspecial effects work best when their presence becomes almost undetectable . \\nin titanic , for which he created a nine-tenths scale model of the entire ship , cameron strove for accuracy at all costs . \\nthe most dramatic moment in the film happens when the ship breaks in two , and the front section becomes vertical in the water . \\npeople are flung like ants either into the water to be shortly frozen to death or into other parts of the ship to be crushed immediately . \\nbesides being romantic and dramatic , the script includes liberal doses of humor . \\nfrom the many deliciously subtle verbal put-downs to the physical comedy , as when jack teaches rose to spit like a man , the show elicits laughter in addition to perhaps a few tears . \\n \\\" it's good-bye for a little while , \\\" a less than confident father tells his little girl since it was indeed women and children first . \\n \\\" this boat's for mommies and children . \\nthere'll be a boat in a little while for daddies . \\\" \\nbasically there was a design decision to have fewer than half of the necessary life boats -- it made the decks look too crowded otherwise . \\nperhaps the sinking is best summarized by one of the guggenheim's on-board the ship . \\nin the dining room with the lifeboats gone and the ship certain to sink , he is offered a life jacket by one of the crew . \\n \\\" no thanks , \\\" the elegantly attired guggenheim replies . \\n \\\" we're dressed in our best and would prefer to go down like gentlemen . \\nbut we would like a brandy . \\\" \\ntitanic runs 3 : 14 . \\nit is rated pg-13 for tastefully and delicately presented sex and nudity and would be fine for kids twelve and up . \\n\",\n          \"ingredients : down-on-his-luck evangelist , church \\nsynopsis : sonny dewey ( robert duvall ) is a tireless texas pentecostal preacher who unexpectedly catches his wife ( farrah fawcett ) in bed with another guy . \\nin a regrettable crime of passion he takes a baseball bat to the guy's head , and suddenly finds himself a fugitive for murder , and estranged from his wife and two kids . \\nto atone for his sins , sonny flees to a rural bayou town in louisiana and baptizes himself as a new creature - - the apostle e . f . as the apostle e . f . sonny's main mission is to revive an abandoned church community and preach the gospel at the local radio station . \\nsoon he sets about resurrecting the one way road to heaven holiness temple . \\nbut sonny knows his time is short ; one day the police will find him . \\nopinion : this movie is a thought-provoking look at an evangelist in real life terms . \\ni believe that robert duvall ( who is the producer , director , writer , and main star of the apostle ) deserves an oscar for his performance as sonny the religious crusader - - a performance which is so complex and realistic it ranks as one of the finest acting performances on film . \\nduvall's portrayal of a true believer is authentic , superb , and inspired ; it offers the audience a completely honest look at southern religion , as well as a portrait of a fallible , complicated man driven by his beliefs . \\nincidentally , in real life duvall was just as 'driven' in getting the project underway . \\nsince no major hollywood studio wanted to risk financing a complex movie about an evangelist , the apostle as a project lay dormant for almost 13 years before duvall was able to get it done , paying for its production with his own money ( about five million dollars ) . \\nin terms of hard-hitting realism and character portrayal the apostle would rank as one of the best movies of this decade , and i emphatically recommend the apostle for connoisseurs of stage and fine acting on film . \\nsimilarly , those with a steep background in pentecostal christianity would find the apostle a thought-provoking experience . \\non the other hand , the apostle's main strength - - duvall's preaching - - is also what limits the apostle's target audience . \\nin terms of plot and pure entertainment value , the apostle is definitely not for everyone . \\nteenagers , action fans , comedy fans , and people who find church completely boring should stay far away from this movie , since three quarters of the film is watching sonny preach at church . \\nin other words , the apostle is a four star performance , but with a very limited audience . \\n\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n
