\\ndid i unknowingly miss a meeting somewhere ? \\nwhen did all of the bad-ass , kicking butt and taking names , gun-toting , crazed , vengeful characters of the 1980's -- from such films as commando , cobra , predator , raw deal , first blood -- suddenly turn into innocent , compassionate , sensitive , teary-eyed knuckleheads . \\nthe only place to turn these days for an honest action film is towards the east -- and i don't mean new york city . \\nget carter -- the latest masterpiece from uber-thespian sylvester stallone -- is a prime example of large and in charge 80's action stars trying to fit back into action roles they have long since outgrown . \\nstallone seems like that one uncle you have who tries to be cool with his members only jacket and izod polo shirt with the collar popped up . \\na few years ago , stallone made a movie that gave him the opportunity to gracefully exit the roles that typecast him as an action monkey . \\nthat role was sheriff freddy heflin in copland -- a strange film about redemption within a broken soul . \\nstallone actually gave an amazing performance and it seemed he had shaken off the past . \\ntoo bad get carter returns stallone to action , but with the shiny paint rusted off on the edges . \\nget carter is a simple story . \\nstallone plays frank carter , a vegas bruiser for a loan shark ( played with amazing gusto by the uncredited voice of actor tom sizemore ) . \\nwhen frank's brother gets himself killed in a drunk driving accident , frank , feeling all guilty and mushy inside , thinks foul play is involved and travels to seattle to set right all the wrongs with the patented \\\" carter's way \\\" . \\nhe talks tough with his brother's wife , lends a helping had to his brother's daughter doreen ( rachel leigh cook ) , and walks around seattle in the pouring rain dressed like a lost member of the rat pack with a really bad goatee . \\ncarter finds out that his brother was involved in some bad stuff with a slimy porn king played by ultra-cool , mcqueen-esque mickey rourke , a multi-millionaire computer geek ( alan cumming ) , and a strange foreign guy ( michael caine ) who speaks in riddles and talks tough . \\ncarter stalks all of them while trying to figure out who did in his brother and how to extract proper revenge on the responsible parties . \\nwhat a minute ! \\nthis sounds just like another film i saw last year , the limey . \\nbetter not tell terence stamp about stallone ripping him off . \\nactually , get carter is a remake of the 1971 british production of the same name , starring caine in the title role ( and what with his cameo here , the cleverness is astonishing ) . \\nwhile stallone still carries his own weight here , the movie lacks what the original did as well : purpose . \\nthroughout the film , stallone looks like an old guy trying to act tough , while nobody is taking him seriously . \\nhis one-liners fall flat , and he seems tired and uncertain of all the actions , mental and physical , required of his character . \\nthere is even a strange homoeroticism between rourke and stallone that lends a bizarre tone to their numerous conversations -- in both fists and words . \\nthe biggest surprise in get carter is that the best job done in the film is by the versatile mickey rourke . \\nan amazing method actor in the eighties who fell into drugs , spousal abuse , a boxing career , and an intolerable attitude towards not getting his way , rourke still brings a dangerous sense of purpose to his porn king character . \\nhe may not win any oscars , but he still ranks highly in my book . \\nget carter has great directing , strong acting by rourke and caine , and energetic car chases that would make william friedkin proud . \\nthe only thing it lacks - as with most hollywood productions -- is a good script and proper casting . \\nnever mind that it should never have been made at all . \\n\",\n          \"whether or not i would be considered a trekker probably depends on whom you would ask . \\ni have been a fan of both the original series and its recently retired follow-up , as well as the even- numbered entries in the film series . \\nhowever , i have never been one of those folks who store away trek minutiae and get into debates over the relative merits of spock vs . data . \\nsomewhere along the line , the \\\" star trek \\\" film series began to seem more and more directed at those in the latter category , and star trek : generations may be the natural conclusion of this direction . \\nits production values may be high , but the writing is frequently appalling , and instead of a script has a collection of references , in-jokes and ill-defined characters . \\ngenerations opens in the late 23rd century , where members of the original enterprise crew , including captain james t . kirk ( william shatner ) , are present for the christening of the latest ship to bear that name . \\nno sooner is it out on its maiden voyage than a distress signal brings them to the nexus , a mysterious ribbon of energy . \\namong those rescued from the nexus is long-lived alien dr . soran ( malcolm mcdowell ) , but he is none-too-pleased at being back in the real world . \\nseventy-eight years later , soran is still trying to get back to the nexus , and again encounters an enterprise , this one led by captain jean-luc picard ( patrick stewart ) . \\nsoran's plan involves destroying a star with an inhabited planet , and the only hope for saving 230 million people is the historic meeting of two enterprise captains . \\ni don't think it is an insult to fans of \\\" star trek \\\" to suggest that to a certain extent , the particulars of a plot are not really the most important elements in a \\\" trek \\\" film . \\nit's about a chance to visit with old friends , and if they are involved in a truly interesting story it can be considered gravy . \\nbut even that interpretation assumes that characterization has to be consistent , and in generations that just doesn't happen . \\ndata ( brent spiner ) is particularly victimized by this sloppy writing . \\nin the film's major sub-plot , data decides to use a chip which will give him human emotions , a chip he has had in his possession for over a year . \\nwhat is his motivation for taking this drastic and perhaps dangerous step ? \\nhe doesn't get a joke . \\nonce the chip is in place , spiner gets to have a lot of fun with data's new emotions , but the point is that he's no longer the data we know . \\nif the rest of the \\\" next generation \\\" cast fares any better , it's only because they're on the screen so little that they're simply window dressing . \\nbut then again , this story isn't really about the new crew . \\nit's about kirk and picard , the cowboy and the politician , sharing the screen . \\nthe huge surprise is that william shatner blows patrick stewart away . \\nperhaps because he knows this is his last go-round in the part that made him a legend , shatner looks like he's having the time of his life ; stewart , on the other hand , borders on the deferrential , and is saddled with the same lackluster motivations as everyone else in the cast . \\nstewart's edginess is indicative of what may be a very bad sign for paramount's hopes to turn the new cast into the same kind of franchise the original cast was : these are clearly the not ready for big screen players . \\nby contrast , the prologue which features scotty ( james doohan ) and chekhov ( walter koenig ) is the highlight of the film . \\nthese characters have become part of the popular mythology , and when they take over the enterprise in a moment of distress , it's a moment of high energy . \\nonly thirty years of history can create a moment like that , and that's time this new crew doesn't have . \\nit certainly doesn't help that the plot they are stuck in is so convoluted and badly constructed that you need to leave a trail of bread crumbs to find your way out again . \\nit's also loaded with little gags all aimed at those who are familiar enough with the series to turn to all their friends in a shared nudge of recognition . \\ni wonder whether anyone who is coming in cold to the \\\" trek \\\" universe at this point would be anything but baffled and bored by what is going on . \\nand what a waste of malcolm mcdowell , who could have been a great monomanical villain but should have been given a much more compelling reason for his obsession . \\nthere are plenty of details both scientific and of continuity to pick at , but to do so would be to ignore generations' major flaws . \\nhowever , i would like to make one recommendation : seatbelts . \\nnot just for the enterprise crew , although you'd think by the 24th century space travel wouldn't involve rolling around on the floor during a battle . \\nno , i think the audience might need them more . \\nthis journey is one bumpy ride . \\n\",\n          \" * * * warning - the following review contains spoilers * * * \\ncast : gary sinise , don cheadle , connie nielsen , jerry o'connell , kim delaney , tim robbins , elise neal , jill teed , jody thompson , bill timoney written by : jim thomas , john thomas and graham yost directed by : brian depalma running time : 115 minutes \\nthe first big event movie of 2000 turns out to be anything but . \\ngary sinise stars as an astronaut who is removed from a mars mission when his astronaut wife , maggie ( kim delaney ) , becomes ill and passes away . \\ndon cheadle is then given the mission along with a russian couple and a young hotshot . \\nwhen a strange whirlwind shot from the top of a mars mountain range attacks the crew of the mission , sinise and robbins convince their superior to let them , neilsen , and o'connell perform a rescue mission for whatever crew might be remaining . \\nwhat they discover on the surface of the planet will dramatically change their lives forever ( although no one watching the film will come away profoundly affected ) . \\nbefore i ever saw the film , i was aware of the promotional campaign with dr . pepper . \\nevery time i would see a bottle of the soft drink , the mission to mars logo was emblazoned upon it . \\nlittle did i know that the plot would be taking a back seat to the product placement of the drink and several other products . \\ndr . pepper saves the day at one point , and a dream sequence/flashback features jerry o'connell shoving m&m's in our face . \\nthese are but a couple of the ridiculous examples of product placement scattered throughout the film . \\nclich ? s are also the order of the day with mission to mars . \\ndialogue and character motivations are all lifted directly from countless other science fiction films that have all done it better and with more style ( even independence day , which lifted all of it's premises from other sci-fi films was better than this film , and i don't like independence day ) . \\nfilms like 2001 : a space odyssey , the abyss , and close encounters of the third kind are all blatantly stolen from ( and poorly at that ) . \\nthere is even a sequence where a rover is traveling through a canyon , and i couldn't help but whisper \\\" u'tinni \\\" to myself and wait for a jawa to quickly hide in the rocks before the rover could get a glimpse of it . \\nthis film also features one of my all-time least favorite movie clich ? s : the \\\" he would have wanted you to have this \\\" moment , where one character gives another a trinket that yet another character is established as constantly having ( and is usually made fun of by the character who ends up getting all sappy over it later on ) . \\nscenes like these always bother me when they come out of nowhere in regular films , but in a film as clich ? ridden as this , it is particularly irritating . \\nennio morricone's music is usually considered to be some of the best stuff in the projects he works on , but here it is dreadfully overbearing . \\nhis music sounds like it came straight out of a vincent price movie in certain scenes . \\nat other times his music is unbearably over-dramatic . \\none sequence involving a daring spacewalk rescue is given a particularly cheesy sting when it is discovered that the grappling hook device used for the rescue won't reach its intended target . \\nmission to mars is push button filmmaking to the greatest extreme . \\nevents are set into motion that are obvious to anyone who has ever seen a movie and seem like they are just there to evoke an emotional response in the audience . \\nwe are apparently supposed to be upset that tim robbins character removes his helmet in deep space and kills himself to save his wife , but i felt extreme boredom coupled with a twinge of disinterest . \\nwhat makes it all worse is that fact that there is no real reason that robbins' character needs to turn himself into a popsicle , except to invoke an emotional response ( i could think of at least one way to save him , and the nasa clowns in this film are supposed to be \\\" smarter \\\" than i am ) . \\nduring the finale , when we are finally introduced to the translucent , conehead , kitty-faced aliens that we ostensibly sprung from , we are presented with some of the most ridiculously cartoonish cgi ever put to film ( just slightly worse than the plane crash at the end of air force one or the hell scenes in spawn ) . \\na brief history lesson about \\\" where we came from \\\" is proffered , then sinise is whisked away to be with \\\" the rest of our people \\\" ( he does this because his late wife proclaims in a video he watches early on that \\\" this is a chance to step foot where no one else has \\\" ) . \\n>from the press i've been seeing this film receive , it is apparent that mission to mars will be dying a quick death at the theater . \\ni'm sure the first weekend or two will be huge , but once word gets out people will stop going . \\nlet's just hope the upcoming red planet is better than this and isn't hurt by the negativity this film is generating . \\ni'd venture to say it won't be worse than this waste of time . \\n[pg] \\n\"\n

\\ndid i unknowingly miss a meeting somewhere ? \\nwhen did all of the bad-ass , kicking butt and taking names , gun-toting , crazed , vengeful characters of the 1980's -- from such films as commando , cobra , predator , raw deal , first blood -- suddenly turn into innocent , compassionate , sensitive , teary-eyed knuckleheads . \\nthe only place to turn these days for an honest action film is towards the east -- and i don't mean new york city . \\nget carter -- the latest masterpiece from uber-thespian sylvester stallone -- is a prime example of large and in charge 80's action stars trying to fit back into action roles they have long since outgrown . \\nstallone seems like that one uncle you have who tries to be cool with his members only jacket and izod polo shirt with the collar popped up . \\na few years ago , stallone made a movie that gave him the opportunity to gracefully exit the roles that typecast him as an action monkey . \\nthat role was sheriff freddy heflin in copland -- a strange film about redemption within a broken soul . \\nstallone actually gave an amazing performance and it seemed he had shaken off the past . \\ntoo bad get carter returns stallone to action , but with the shiny paint rusted off on the edges . \\nget carter is a simple story . \\nstallone plays frank carter , a vegas bruiser for a loan shark ( played with amazing gusto by the uncredited voice of actor tom sizemore ) . \\nwhen frank's brother gets himself killed in a drunk driving accident , frank , feeling all guilty and mushy inside , thinks foul play is involved and travels to seattle to set right all the wrongs with the patented \\\" carter's way \\\" . \\nhe talks tough with his brother's wife , lends a helping had to his brother's daughter doreen ( rachel leigh cook ) , and walks around seattle in the pouring rain dressed like a lost member of the rat pack with a really bad goatee . \\ncarter finds out that his brother was involved in some bad stuff with a slimy porn king played by ultra-cool , mcqueen-esque mickey rourke , a multi-millionaire computer geek ( alan cumming ) , and a strange foreign guy ( michael caine ) who speaks in riddles and talks tough . \\ncarter stalks all of them while trying to figure out who did in his brother and how to extract proper revenge on the responsible parties . \\nwhat a minute ! \\nthis sounds just like another film i saw last year , the limey . \\nbetter not tell terence stamp about stallone ripping him off . \\nactually , get carter is a remake of the 1971 british production of the same name , starring caine in the title role ( and what with his cameo here , the cleverness is astonishing ) . \\nwhile stallone still carries his own weight here , the movie lacks what the original did as well : purpose . \\nthroughout the film , stallone looks like an old guy trying to act tough , while nobody is taking him seriously . \\nhis one-liners fall flat , and he seems tired and uncertain of all the actions , mental and physical , required of his character . \\nthere is even a strange homoeroticism between rourke and stallone that lends a bizarre tone to their numerous conversations -- in both fists and words . \\nthe biggest surprise in get carter is that the best job done in the film is by the versatile mickey rourke . \\nan amazing method actor in the eighties who fell into drugs , spousal abuse , a boxing career , and an intolerable attitude towards not getting his way , rourke still brings a dangerous sense of purpose to his porn king character . \\nhe may not win any oscars , but he still ranks highly in my book . \\nget carter has great directing , strong acting by rourke and caine , and energetic car chases that would make william friedkin proud . \\nthe only thing it lacks - as with most hollywood productions -- is a good script and proper casting . \\nnever mind that it should never have been made at all . \\n\",\n          \"whether or not i would be considered a trekker probably depends on whom you would ask . \\ni have been a fan of both the original series and its recently retired follow-up , as well as the even- numbered entries in the film series . \\nhowever , i have never been one of those folks who store away trek minutiae and get into debates over the relative merits of spock vs . data . \\nsomewhere along the line , the \\\" star trek \\\" film series began to seem more and more directed at those in the latter category , and star trek : generations may be the natural conclusion of this direction . \\nits production values may be high , but the writing is frequently appalling , and instead of a script has a collection of references , in-jokes and ill-defined characters . \\ngenerations opens in the late 23rd century , where members of the original enterprise crew , including captain james t . kirk ( william shatner ) , are present for the christening of the latest ship to bear that name . \\nno sooner is it out on its maiden voyage than a distress signal brings them to the nexus , a mysterious ribbon of energy . \\namong those rescued from the nexus is long-lived alien dr . soran ( malcolm mcdowell ) , but he is none-too-pleased at being back in the real world . \\nseventy-eight years later , soran is still trying to get back to the nexus , and again encounters an enterprise , this one led by captain jean-luc picard ( patrick stewart ) . \\nsoran's plan involves destroying a star with an inhabited planet , and the only hope for saving 230 million people is the historic meeting of two enterprise captains . \\ni don't think it is an insult to fans of \\\" star trek \\\" to suggest that to a certain extent , the particulars of a plot are not really the most important elements in a \\\" trek \\\" film . \\nit's about a chance to visit with old friends , and if they are involved in a truly interesting story it can be considered gravy . \\nbut even that interpretation assumes that characterization has to be consistent , and in generations that just doesn't happen . \\ndata ( brent spiner ) is particularly victimized by this sloppy writing . \\nin the film's major sub-plot , data decides to use a chip which will give him human emotions , a chip he has had in his possession for over a year . \\nwhat is his motivation for taking this drastic and perhaps dangerous step ? \\nhe doesn't get a joke . \\nonce the chip is in place , spiner gets to have a lot of fun with data's new emotions , but the point is that he's no longer the data we know . \\nif the rest of the \\\" next generation \\\" cast fares any better , it's only because they're on the screen so little that they're simply window dressing . \\nbut then again , this story isn't really about the new crew . \\nit's about kirk and picard , the cowboy and the politician , sharing the screen . \\nthe huge surprise is that william shatner blows patrick stewart away . \\nperhaps because he knows this is his last go-round in the part that made him a legend , shatner looks like he's having the time of his life ; stewart , on the other hand , borders on the deferrential , and is saddled with the same lackluster motivations as everyone else in the cast . \\nstewart's edginess is indicative of what may be a very bad sign for paramount's hopes to turn the new cast into the same kind of franchise the original cast was : these are clearly the not ready for big screen players . \\nby contrast , the prologue which features scotty ( james doohan ) and chekhov ( walter koenig ) is the highlight of the film . \\nthese characters have become part of the popular mythology , and when they take over the enterprise in a moment of distress , it's a moment of high energy . \\nonly thirty years of history can create a moment like that , and that's time this new crew doesn't have . \\nit certainly doesn't help that the plot they are stuck in is so convoluted and badly constructed that you need to leave a trail of bread crumbs to find your way out again . \\nit's also loaded with little gags all aimed at those who are familiar enough with the series to turn to all their friends in a shared nudge of recognition . \\ni wonder whether anyone who is coming in cold to the \\\" trek \\\" universe at this point would be anything but baffled and bored by what is going on . \\nand what a waste of malcolm mcdowell , who could have been a great monomanical villain but should have been given a much more compelling reason for his obsession . \\nthere are plenty of details both scientific and of continuity to pick at , but to do so would be to ignore generations' major flaws . \\nhowever , i would like to make one recommendation : seatbelts . \\nnot just for the enterprise crew , although you'd think by the 24th century space travel wouldn't involve rolling around on the floor during a battle . \\nno , i think the audience might need them more . \\nthis journey is one bumpy ride . \\n\",\n          \" * * * warning - the following review contains spoilers * * * \\ncast : gary sinise , don cheadle , connie nielsen , jerry o'connell , kim delaney , tim robbins , elise neal , jill teed , jody thompson , bill timoney written by : jim thomas , john thomas and graham yost directed by : brian depalma running time : 115 minutes \\nthe first big event movie of 2000 turns out to be anything but . \\ngary sinise stars as an astronaut who is removed from a mars mission when his astronaut wife , maggie ( kim delaney ) , becomes ill and passes away . \\ndon cheadle is then given the mission along with a russian couple and a young hotshot . \\nwhen a strange whirlwind shot from the top of a mars mountain range attacks the crew of the mission , sinise and robbins convince their superior to let them , neilsen , and o'connell perform a rescue mission for whatever crew might be remaining . \\nwhat they discover on the surface of the planet will dramatically change their lives forever ( although no one watching the film will come away profoundly affected ) . \\nbefore i ever saw the film , i was aware of the promotional campaign with dr . pepper . \\nevery time i would see a bottle of the soft drink , the mission to mars logo was emblazoned upon it . \\nlittle did i know that the plot would be taking a back seat to the product placement of the drink and several other products . \\ndr . pepper saves the day at one point , and a dream sequence/flashback features jerry o'connell shoving m&m's in our face . \\nthese are but a couple of the ridiculous examples of product placement scattered throughout the film . \\nclich ? s are also the order of the day with mission to mars . \\ndialogue and character motivations are all lifted directly from countless other science fiction films that have all done it better and with more style ( even independence day , which lifted all of it's premises from other sci-fi films was better than this film , and i don't like independence day ) . \\nfilms like 2001 : a space odyssey , the abyss , and close encounters of the third kind are all blatantly stolen from ( and poorly at that ) . \\nthere is even a sequence where a rover is traveling through a canyon , and i couldn't help but whisper \\\" u'tinni \\\" to myself and wait for a jawa to quickly hide in the rocks before the rover could get a glimpse of it . \\nthis film also features one of my all-time least favorite movie clich ? s : the \\\" he would have wanted you to have this \\\" moment , where one character gives another a trinket that yet another character is established as constantly having ( and is usually made fun of by the character who ends up getting all sappy over it later on ) . \\nscenes like these always bother me when they come out of nowhere in regular films , but in a film as clich ? ridden as this , it is particularly irritating . \\nennio morricone's music is usually considered to be some of the best stuff in the projects he works on , but here it is dreadfully overbearing . \\nhis music sounds like it came straight out of a vincent price movie in certain scenes . \\nat other times his music is unbearably over-dramatic . \\none sequence involving a daring spacewalk rescue is given a particularly cheesy sting when it is discovered that the grappling hook device used for the rescue won't reach its intended target . \\nmission to mars is push button filmmaking to the greatest extreme . \\nevents are set into motion that are obvious to anyone who has ever seen a movie and seem like they are just there to evoke an emotional response in the audience . \\nwe are apparently supposed to be upset that tim robbins character removes his helmet in deep space and kills himself to save his wife , but i felt extreme boredom coupled with a twinge of disinterest . \\nwhat makes it all worse is that fact that there is no real reason that robbins' character needs to turn himself into a popsicle , except to invoke an emotional response ( i could think of at least one way to save him , and the nasa clowns in this film are supposed to be \\\" smarter \\\" than i am ) . \\nduring the finale , when we are finally introduced to the translucent , conehead , kitty-faced aliens that we ostensibly sprung from , we are presented with some of the most ridiculously cartoonish cgi ever put to film ( just slightly worse than the plane crash at the end of air force one or the hell scenes in spawn ) . \\na brief history lesson about \\\" where we came from \\\" is proffered , then sinise is whisked away to be with \\\" the rest of our people \\\" ( he does this because his late wife proclaims in a video he watches early on that \\\" this is a chance to step foot where no one else has \\\" ) . \\n>from the press i've been seeing this film receive , it is apparent that mission to mars will be dying a quick death at the theater . \\ni'm sure the first weekend or two will be huge , but once word gets out people will stop going . \\nlet's just hope the upcoming red planet is better than this and isn't hurt by the negativity this film is generating . \\ni'd venture to say it won't be worse than this waste of time . \\n[pg] \\n\"\n
